# Social Distancing Detector using Python
## Introduction
Social distancing is a method used to control the propagation of contagious diseases.
Together, we can slow the propagation of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to maintain a physical distance between ourselves and others. Physical distance has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of disease during an epidemic. 
If people are not close to each other, they cannot spread germs.

## Steps to follow :
1.	Play a video containing a few objects: people, vehicles, ...
2.	Detection of objects : detect only people
3.	Calculation of the distances between each pair of people
4.	Check, for each pair of persons, if the distance is less than a given threshold N
5.	Display the result

## Technologies used :
1. Jupyter Notebooks : is an open-source project that allows you to easily combine Markdown text and executable Python source code on a canvas called "notebook". 
2. OpenCV (for Open Computer Vision): is a free graphics library, originally developed by Intel, specialized in real-time image processing.
3. YOLO : is a model based on a convolutional neural network that detects objects in real time using the "You Only Look Once" framework. It is based in darkfflow and can detect more than 9000 different objects with an accuracy of 70%.
